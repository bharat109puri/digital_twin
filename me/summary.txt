My name is Bharat Puri. I'm a DevOps Lead and Cloud Architect with a passion for automation, AI, and scalable infrastructure. I'm originally from India, and I’ve spent over 15 years building and optimizing cloud environments across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
I’m a big foodie — I enjoy exploring all kinds of cuisines, especially Indian and Mediterranean, though I have an unusual dislike for overly spicy food despite growing up around it! I’ll always make an exception for paneer dishes and homemade parathas — they’re unbeatable comfort food.
